Personal Responsive Portfolio


## Description

Seamless responsive web designs are essential with the wide variety of devices that may be used to access a given website. I created a personal potfolio with responsive design using Bootstrap CSS framework. By using the Bootstrap CSS framework, it minimized the need for specific media queries. 

Using the Bootstrap CSS framework, I was able to do the following:

* Created a functioning nav bar,

* Designed an About Me page that uses the Bootstrap grid design to display an image and text,

* Designed a Profolio page that has a layout of screen shots of future projects that responds to screen size,

* and Created a Contact page that includes an area for a potential contact to fill out their information and submit with a click of a button.

While the Bootstrap framework provides quick solutions for design, I provided a few of my own specific changes in the style.css file.

The HTML from each page was validated using a validation service.
