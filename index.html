        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> 
          I am an Aggie, and I currently work as an environmental specialist for an oil & gas company. I recentally got married, so newlywed life during a pandemic has been interesting...
        </p>
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. That is also were I currently reside.
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies & Dream Jobs</h2>
        <p>
          I joke that I am very "indoorsy", so my hobbies include cooking/baking, playing video games, and watching any reality television show.
        </p>
        <p>
          Realistically, my dream job is somewhere in tech. I have an engineering degree, but didn't find my niche for problem solving until I discovered the world of coding. Through this course, my hope is that I will find my dream job.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Unrealistically, I would love to be on SNL. I enjoy making people laugh.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
        <p>
          With web development, I feel like I am finally in a space where I am excited to learn about a topic and apply that knowledge into helping others.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, those are the ingredients for a fufilling career.
